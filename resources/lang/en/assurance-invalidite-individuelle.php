    'intro_text' => '<strong>Individual disability insurance</strong> is a type of coverage that protects you in the event of an inability to work due to illness or injury. This protection is ideal for employees who do not have group disability insurance with their employer, as well as for business owners and self-employed workers. Individual insurance also helps bridge the gaps left by other insurance plans (public and group).',

    // Section Citation (Grey)
    'quote_text' => "Indeed, employer group insurance typically covers only a percentage of your full salary. By supplementing your coverage with individual disability insurance, you can protect your entire income, even if you change jobs. Premiums are generally lower because the protection is personalized and not affected by the claims experience of a specific group.",
