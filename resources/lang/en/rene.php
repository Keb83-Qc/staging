        ['q' => 'What exactly is a non-registered savings plan?', 'a' => 'It is an investment account that is not registered with the government, meaning it offers no immediate tax shelter but provides total flexibility with no contribution limits.'],
        ['q' => 'Is a non-registered savings plan taxable?', 'a' => 'Yes. Unlike a TFSA, income (interest, dividends, capital gains) is taxable in the year it is generated.'],
        ['q' => 'Is there a contribution limit?', 'a' => 'No. There is no limit to the amount you can invest in a non-registered plan.'],
        ['q' => 'Can I withdraw my money at any time?', 'a' => 'Yes. Funds are fully liquid and accessible without tax penalties or age restrictions.'],
        ['q' => 'Is it better than an RRSP or TFSA?', 'a' => 'It does not replace them. It is an ideal supplement once RRSP and TFSA limits are maximized.'],
        ['q' => 'What types of investments can be held?', 'a' => 'Almost all: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, GICs, and cash.'],

        ['q' => 'Is income taxed every year?', 'a' => 'Yes. In a non-registered plan, income is taxed in the year it is generated, even if it is not withdrawn from the account.'],
        ['q' => 'What is the exact taxation by income type?', 'a' => 'Interest is 100% taxable, Canadian dividends benefit from a tax credit, and capital gains are only 50% taxable.'],
        ['q' => 'Can taxes be deferred in a non-registered plan?', 'a' => 'Yes, indirectly. As long as you do not sell your securities, capital gains are not "realized," allowing you to defer tax on growth.'],
        ['q' => 'Can tax losses be used?', 'a' => 'Yes. Capital losses can offset capital gains. They can also be carried back 3 years or forward indefinitely.'],
        ['q' => 'Is the plan relevant even with a TFSA and RRSP?', 'a' => 'Absolutely. It becomes essential when limits are reached, flexibility is a priority, or overall taxation needs optimization.'],
        ['q' => 'Can it be used for estate planning?', 'a' => 'Yes. It offers great flexibility for income splitting (in some cases), gifting of securities, and wealth transfer.'],
